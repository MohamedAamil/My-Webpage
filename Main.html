                    Drawing has been a constant partner of me during my free time in classes. Every last pages of my class notes
                    <br>
                    and my rough notes were always filled with doodles. Very Good times.
                    <br>
                    The lockdown helped me to further hone these doodles into proper drawings.

                    Since the day I discovered the existence of Programming, I have been so intrigued by how majority of the things I use
                    <br>
                    was made possible by some typing in through coding.
                    <br><br>
                    Now I have currently learned, C++, Python and learning HTML, CSS. You can check out my GitHub to see my work.
